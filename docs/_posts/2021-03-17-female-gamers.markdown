Esports, or "competitive tournaments of video games, especially among professional gamers," [officially entered](https://www.pcgamer.com/esports-is-now-officially-in-the-dictionary/) the lexicon on Dictionary.com in 2015. Video game competitions have been going on for a while though! In this notebook, we'll track the evolution of the esports world from data on [https://www.esportsearnings.com](https://www.esportsearnings.com).

## Top Games
The website esportsearnings.com lists historic data on earnings for games throughout the years, along with some top 500 datasets of females, console players, fighting games, and the oldest players. Below I chart off the top games by earnings (adjusted for 2019 USD).

Dota2, Counterstrike, Fortnite... Interestingly, these guys dominant League of Legends (LoL), which is the game that first got me familiar with esports. 


As an aside, I wanted to see where women are making their place.
