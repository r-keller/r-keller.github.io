Applied Math PhD seeking a job in technology and mathematical modeling. 

This website is to link to some fun apps with data!

I've begun an app to see the different hero selections for the video game Dota 2, check it out [here](https://dota2dash.herokuapp.com)! For this first app, I'm using a combination of [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) for displaying data, [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) for adding interactivity, and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for web hosting.
